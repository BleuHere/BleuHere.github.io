          <h3><span>WHAT IS EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE?</span></h3>
          <p>Emotional intelligence is being aware of and accountable for our emotions and actions in how we relate to ourselves and others. It’s practicing compassion, individualization and empathy and being responsive as opposed to reactive. It’s seeking to see ourselves in a more objective light, not being crowded by internal or external judgement, and choosing to accept how ourselves and others are feeling at the present moment. It’s being honest with ourselves and others about what we are feeling, what our current capabilities are, and where our personal boundaries are drawn. </p>

          <h3><span>WHY IS IT RELEVANT?</span></h3>
          <p>Emotional Intelliegence (EQ) is really important in both the relationship we have with ourselves and the relationships we have with others. When we tune into broadening and deepening our EQ, we make ourselves kinder, more empathetic, and generally more attuned to our values. This closeness to and awareness of the self can create an environment of safety and security for ourselves and others. Being safe allows us to raise our voices, make mistakes and share things that are tender to us without fear of shame and judgement from ourselves and others. </p>
          <p>This safe space is where I feel most cosy and accepted, and where I can learn and grow. If we create more spaces like this, we can deepen our relationships and create lasting connections. </p>
          <p>This also leads to productivity and workplace harmony if we are looking at this through the lens of teams and workplaces.</p>
