          <p>
            My long term goal is to work in the social impact space, utilising
            technology to make support more accessible to minority groups,
            especially women and the LGBT+ community, and to combat the climate
            crisis. I see myself doing this by working for apps and
            organisations who already work in this space, and one day building
            an organisation with a committed team and create a piece of
            technology that fills a need in these communities.

            I would love to develop my team-work skills. I know that in cases
            where I like my team-mates I can really thrive, but if I don’t
            easily connect with my team-mates I can find this distracting. I
            would love to develop good tools and strategies for genuinely
            connecting with people I don’t naturally gravitate towards.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’d also love to develop leadership skills. I would love to work in
            a leadership position and learning more about how value-driven
            leadership works in a real-world sense would be really impactful in
            my learning journey.

          <p>
            I will work productively and safely with others by keeping in touch
            with my mind and body and applying coping mechanisms to
            self-regulate if I feel activated, distracted or
            <span class="emphasis">‘off’</span>. This may look like logging off
            discord for a little while, taking a walk or connecting with
            somebody and having a chat.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will focus on kindness, gentleness and compassion towards myself
            and others.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will be mindful of my space-taking during classtime and ask
            questions where relevent. I will respect the time and energy of my
            classmates and facilitators by ensuring my contribution to
            discussions is pertinent and useful.
          </p>
          <h4>
            <span
              >What you will do when things are building up and starting to get

            >
          </h4>
          <p>
            I will remind myself that I have been preparing for this and that I
            can get through this! I will take breaks and move my body. I will
            prioritise rest and physical wellbeing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In moments of tension I will take myself to a safe spot (physically
            or in my mind) and allow myself to regluate before I get back into
            what I was doing. This might look like going for a walk, venting to
            a willing friend, having a cry or just gently reminding myself that
            discomfort is okay.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will communicate my needs with class-mates/team-mates and/or
            facilitators when necessary, and be self-reliant where possible.
            This looks like - self care as above, or using google, MDN,
            StackOverflow and other tools to help me solve technical issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            When self-reliance actually looks like asking for help, I will turn
            to my academic and wellbeing support network - facilitators,
            friends, family and partner.

          <p>
            I’ll reach out to my classmates in discord first, then, I’ll chat to
            my partner who is a senior software engineer. If I am still unclear
            or haven’t met the learning objective then I will contact a
            facilitator (either in the help requests discord channel or contact
            my cohort facilitator directly.

          <p>
            I know that I will have moments of learning struggle. The big hurdle
            for me will be my reaction to my learning and I anticipate some
            mental struggles. Fortunately, I have a great counsellor who I can
            talk to, and I have great home, partner and familial support to be
            there for me if it starts feeling like too much.

            patience and humility. I expect that celebration is a part of the
            facilitation team’s values, but that validation isn’t given
            willy-nilly. I really want to feel safe to make mistakes, and to not

            I’m hoping to become a developer! I would love to work on solving
            pertinent issues that humans and the planet face. I think I’m much
            more interested in the back end structuring and functionality, but
            the truth is that I don’t really know yet. It’s exciting to know I
            will get to try lots of stuff!

          <p>
            I would love to be a part of making useful SaaS technology that
            could combat things like climate change and inequalities in the
            human world. I’m really interested in the impact fashion has on
            people and the planet, and would love to work on creating solutions
            around this. Other causes I feel strongly about are gender equality
            and climate change. I’ve been looking into carbon credits which
            seems pretty cool, but I’m curious about what else is out there.

          </h3>
          <p>
            I think that my strengths and limitations have changed! I know that
            throughout Foundations I’ve been really focussing on how I respond
            to my being stuck and feeling stupid. I’ve noticed a big difference
            in my reaction to those thoughts and feelings, and feel like I have
            been able to disarm those thoughts through self awareness and
            kindness to myself. I’m still working on letting lingering pestering
            feelings and thoughts go… Bootcamp will be great practice for this.
          </p>
          <p>
            A strength I’ve noticed in myself is healthy resource management.
            I’ve been able to recognise when I need a shorter day due to mental
            or physical needs, and I can manage my workload well while I also
            tend to myself. I think this will be different in Bootcamp as the
            days will be longer and more prescribed, but I do think that honing
            this skill in a higher stress environment will be really beneficial
            to my growth.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think my communications skills will serve me well, and I look
            forward to developing these further by looping and practising
            healthy teamwork.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m also really excited to do lots of learning! I was pretty nervous
            to start Foundations, but my brain is doing me so proud! I’ve been
            loving the learning and I feel like my brain is ready for more!

            <span>

              will be?</span
            >
          </h3>
          <p>
            A limitation I anticipate in Bootcamp is resilience to mental
            exhaustion. I struggle with mental health, and find that if my brain
            is tired it’s really hard for me to focus. During Foundations I’ve
            been able to manage my time around these days, but I do feel nervous
            for those days in Bootcamp when there’s lots to do and learn but my
            mental capacity is limited.

          </h3>
          <p>
            I’m really excited to work in intentional teams. I’ve worked in
            teams before, but haven’t really felt prepared to work well with
            different personalities and have struggled to develop skills on the
            fly in those situations. I’m really looking forward to working with
            all of my classmates and learning about how they want to interact
            and how they feel safe in a team.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m nervous for peer programming because it challenges me to be
            vulnerable in front of others, so I’m looking forward to feeling
            more comfortable in this setting.

            I think my Foundations expectations will continue on into Bootcamp.
            As below:
          </p>
          <p>
            I expect responsiveness within school hours. I expect the team to be

            in the right direction if I am really stuck.

            validation isn’t given willy-nilly. I really want to feel safe to

            offered an approach, a direction or a gentle prompt. I want to know

            <span> What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</span>
          </h3>
          <p>
            I expect to lean into the learning and give heaps of energy to this.
            I expect myself to stay open and curious. I expect that I will have
            bad days, and know that I am great at supporting myself and asking
            for help.
          </p>
          <p>
            I expect myself to maintain a good routine. I expect to allow myself
            to rest when I need to. I expect that I will face discomfort with
            others and will seek healthy ways to deal with this.
          </p>
          <p>
            I expect to finish the course and I really hope to thrive during it!

            my partner who is a software engineer. If I am still unclear or
            haven’t met the learning objective then I will contact a facilitator
            (either in the help requests discord channel or contact my cohort
            facilitator directly).
          </p>
          <p>
            I will continue to practise kindness, and remind myself that asking
            for help doesn’t mean I’m deficient.

            Keeping in touch with my mind and body and applying coping
            mechanisms to self-regulate if I feel activated, distracted or
            ‘off’. This might look like stretching, taking a break or practising
            mindfulness.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will focus on kindness, gentleness and compassion towards myself
            and others.
          </p>
          <p> 
            I will listen and communicate with kindness and attention. I will
            invite feedback and learn from feedback received.
