          <h3><span>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</span></h3>
    <p>My long term goal is to work in the social impact space, utilising technology to make support more accessible to minority groups, especially women and the LGBT+ community, and to combat the climate crisis. I see myself doing this by working for apps and organisations who already work in this space, and one day building an organisation with a committed team and create a piece of technology that fills a need in these communities. </p>

  <h3><span>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</span></h3>
      <h4>Strengths:</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>well organised and works well in a routine</li>
      <li>ability to connect dots and link new knowledge to existing concepts</li>
      <li>enjoyment found in puzzles and challenges</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Weakness:</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>bit of a bash-bash find-the-solution approach as opposed to a curious approach when things go wrong</li>
      <li>high expectations means I often fall short of my own mark and feel a bit shit about it</li>
      <li>stubborn and finds it tricky to let things go if I haven’t achieved what I set out to do</li>
    </ul>

  <h3><span>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</span></h3>
      <p>I would love to develop my team-work skills. I know that in cases where I like my team-mates I can really thrive, but if I don’t easily connect with my team-mates I can find this distracting. I would love to develop good tools and strategies for genuinely connecting with people I don’t naturally gravitate towards. </p>
      <p>I’d also love to develop leadership skills. I would love to work in a leadership position and learning more about how value-driven leadership works in a real-world sense would be really impactful in my learning journey. </p>

  <h3><span>A commitment to how you will manage your workload:</span></h3>
      <h4><span>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives</span></h4>
      <p>I will work productively and safely with others by keeping in touch with my mind and body and applying coping mechanisms to self-regulate if I feel activated, distracted or <span class="emphasis">‘off’</span>. This may look like logging off discord for a little while, taking a walk or connecting with somebody and having a chat. </p>
      <p>I will focus on kindness, gentleness and compassion towards myself and others. </p>
      <p>I will be mindful of my space-taking during classtime and ask questions where relevent. I will respect the time and energy of my classmates and facilitators by ensuring my contribution to discussions is pertinent and useful. </p>
    <h4><span>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?</span></h4>
      <p>I will remind myself that I have been preparing for this and that I can get through this! I will take breaks and move my body. I will prioritise rest and physical wellbeing. </p>
      <p>In moments of tension I will take myself to a safe spot (physically or in my mind) and allow myself to regluate before I get back into what I was doing. This might look like going for a walk, venting to a willing friend, having a cry or just gently reminding myself that discomfort is okay. </p>
      <p>I will communicate my needs with class-mates/team-mates and/or facilitators when necessary, and be self-reliant where possible. This looks like - self care as above, or using google, MDN, StackOverflow and other tools to help me solve technical issues. </p>
      <p>When self-reliance actually looks like asking for help, I will turn to my academic and wellbeing support network - facilitators, friends, family and partner.</p>

  <h3><span>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:</span></h3>
      <h4>Where:</h4>
      <p>When I am stuck and have exhausted my allocated time and/or energy resources. </p>
      <h4>How: </h4>
      <p>I’ll reach out to my classmates in discord first, then, I’ll chat to my partner who is a senior software engineer. If I am still unclear or haven’t met the learning objective then I will contact a facilitator (either in the help requests discord channel or contact my cohort facilitator directly.</p>
      <p>I know that I will have moments of learning struggle. The big hurdle for me will be my reaction to my learning and I anticipate some mental struggles. Fortunately, I have a great counsellor who I can talk to, and I have great home, partner and familial support to be there for me if it starts feeling like too much. </p>

  <h3><span>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team:</span></h3>
      <p>I expect responsiveness within school hours. I expect the team to be emotionally aware and gentle. I expect great learning analogies, and clear expecations of deliverables. I expect to be helpfully nudged in the right direction if I am really stuck. I expect compassion and patience and humility. I expect that celebration is a part of the facilitation team’s values, but that validation isn’t given willy-nilly. I really want to feel safe to make mistakes, and to not be given the answer if I ask for help, but offered an approach, a direction or a gentle prompt. I want to know that I am safe to feel my feelings and that I am supported or can access support if I ask. </p>

  <h3><span>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</span></h3>
      <p>I cook dinner for my flatmates. During bootcamp this will be once per week. I also need to schedule time to walk my dog, but this is flexible. I have one or two appointments that I can’t reschedule.</p>
