      <h3><span>How does the field of neuroplasticity affect you and me? </span></h3>
      <p>We’re quite meta creatures, and it turns out that understanding our own brains is really empowering to
        us. The knowledge that our brains are capable of change, adaptation and learning allows us to dream big, while
        staying grounded in reality. The proven fact that we can trust our brains to absorb concepts and information
        that we are eager to hold onto is exciting. </p>
      <p>You and I can now pursue our big dreams with science to back us when imposter syndrome or doubtful people try
        to pull us down. This isn’t to say that skills and learning will simply fall into our laps, however it does mean
        that with determination, a good plan and a great support network that our goals aren’t so far out of reach.</p>

      <h3><span>What I learnt about application of neuroplasticity IRL: </span></h3>
      <h4><span>How to engage with the principles of neuroplasticity:</span></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>continue to read/watch/listen to content that discusses neuroplasticity</li>
        <li>converse with friends, mentors, whanau about if and how they have applied this concept to their lives</li>
        <li>remind myself that my brain is malleable and capable of learning hard stuff</li>
        <li>challenge thoughts that arise that relate to me having a fixed ability or capacity</li>
      </ul>
      <h4><span>How to improve neuroplasticity:</span></h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>practise creative thinking and ideation -</strong> read fiction, create art/crafts, play music</li>
        <li><strong>seek new environments -</strong> try new food, travel to another place or explore your own city, go
          to an event
          you’ve never been to before, play new games</li>
        <li><strong>move your body -</strong> learn to play a new sport, dance, get hot and sweaty, practice
          non-dominant hand exercises
        </li>
        <li><strong>learn a new skill -</strong> learn a language, play logic games, make a thing with your hands</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Neither of these are comprehensive lists. <a
          href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/#age-neuroplasticity" class="body-link">Here's an
          article</a> that I found really useful when researching this topic.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3><span>What is a growth mindset? </span></h3>
      <p>Essentially, a growth mindset is the belief in neuroplasticity - one’s own ability to learn and increase in
        intelligence and skills. This goes contrary to popular belief on subjects such as IQ testing - a fixed test that
        ‘proves’ someone’s level of intelligence. I wrote about this <a href="/blog-for-school/emotional-intelligence.html" class="body-link">here</a> if you want to read my thoughts. A growth
        mindset focuses on “If I put in the work, I can achieve this” instead of “If I have the talent, I can achieve
        this’.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3><span>What surprised me when learning about the growth mindset? </span></h3>
      <p>I really enjoyed learning about how cultivating a growth mindset encourages collaboration, appropriate risk
        taking and learning - even when this learning might not actively contribute to a given goal. I think I have
        always thought about a growth mindset as something good for the individual, but didn’t think about how this
        mindset can be a community building value. Very cool. I really enjoyed <a class="body-link"
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qpJxEhOP4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0qpJxEhOP4">this
          video</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3><span>How will I integrate a growth mindset into my learning journey?</span></h3>
      <p>Something I have struggled with is independence or nothing. I really want to acknowledge when I am stuck, and
        seek help. I think that cultivating a growth mindset will allow me to have better self-talk around asking for
        clarity, support and help. </p>
      <p>I would also like to integrate growth mindset into my independent learning through learning to be uncomfortable
        in peace. I want to be in the middle of a seriously frustrating moment of tension between me and my new bestie
        javascript and be able to remind myself that getting something the first time, or writing the best code isn’t
        the definition of success. The optimum outcome is to learn and develop a skill, and to build resilience in times
        of tension.</p>

      <h3><span>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset together: </span></h3>
      <h4><span>Outside of school, I plan to actively train my neuroplasticity through:</span></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>reading fiction</li>
        <li>exercising</li>
        <li>practicing and improving my Spanish</li>
        <li>cooking delicious meals with new techniques and flavours</li>
        <li>training my dog (his neuroplasticity is important too)</li>
      </ul>
      <h4><span>Outside of school, I plan to actively cultivate my growth mindset through:</span></h4>
      <ul>
        <li>affirmations (cheesy, but they’ve been working)</li>
        <li>reflecting on my self-talk and internal narratives when encountering new and old challenges</li>
        <li>chatting with close ones about their own mindset</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These out-of-school activities will strengthen my ability to engage with new tech and core content inside the
        classroom. I am also committed to my existing learning plan, which does take into account my fixed mindset as a limitation. </p>

      <h3><span>fin.</span></h3>
      <p>Thanks for reading! I have some questions for you to ponder too:</p>
      <p>What is your mindset towards learning like? What makes you feel those synapses firing and connecting?</p>
