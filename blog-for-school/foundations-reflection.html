            I can actually change the way that I react to ‘roadblocks’. I don’t
            have to be stuck in the losing/failure mindset - practicing
            self-awareness and self-compassion are tools that really work for
            me.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I can really work on improving my listening! Through the listening
            and looping exercise I realised what it feels like to pay as close
            to 100% attention to the person in front of me and that was a big
            lightbulb moment for me.

            Having a healthy routine is a complete game-changer to my mood,
            productivity and wellbeing. I had never really put in a lot of
            effort to my morning routine, but having one makes so much
            difference. I meditate, exercise, recite affirmations before
            starting the day, and it has made a big impact.

        <h3>
          <span
            >What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in
            learning and programming?</span
          >
        </h3>
        <h4><span>Values:</span></h4>
        <p>
          Values help to give motivation to learning. It provides the ‘why’, and
          allows me to center myself in my learning. I understand that
          everything that I’m learning is in order to align myself further with
          my values.
        </p>
        <p>
          Learning alongside others has allowed me to lean into my values as I
          come across opportunities to both give and receive, and practise my
          values in a different setting.
        </p>
        <p>
          In programming, focussing on my values has mostly related to kindness
          to myself, and practicing compassion. I hope that as I grow as a
          developer that my values will take me into workplaces that center
          around impactful work in the social and environmental sphere.
        </p>
        <h4><span>Empathy:</span></h4>
        <p>
          Empathy in learning has been integral in these first five sprints.
          I’ve needed to be very empathetic with myself when I come across
          something challenging, or when I’m just plain stuck.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’ve really admired the empathy of others in the foundations cohort as
          they spend time helping others figure out where they’re going wrong in
          their code, and also encouraging others for their blog posts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think empathy is really necessary in programming, because it’s hard.
          Often I feel like I have tunnel vision, so when someone points
          something out to me, I could easily kick myself for the oversight, but
          when someone approaches me with empathy, it’s much easier to say to
          myself ‘huh, I’ll definitely keep an eye out for that next time, how
          nice is it to learn something new/solidify my knowledge’.
        </p>
        <h4><span>Self-Awareness:</span></h4>
        <p>
          In learning and programming alike, I think self-awareness is crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
          From physical things like taking a break when I feel hungry, or
          stepping away to grab some water requires self-awareness. On a more
          mental/emotional level, self-awareness has allowed me to take a break
          and tend to my emotional needs OR keep going within certain limits
          when I feel positive and grounded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-awareness allows me to critique my intrusive self talk, and
          affirm myself when I need to.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <span>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          I was surprised about how much more focus I can add to my listening.
          The listening and looping exercises really took me by surprise because
          I never thought of myself as a deficient listener, but afterwards I
          realised how much focus active listening requires.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <span
            >What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</span
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think for me it was facing my limitations and feeling vulnerable,
          and then being in plenty of situations where those limitations where
          activated and challenged. I do want to mention that I’ve noticed a
          huge shift in my self-talk since I really faced my negative self-talk
          as a limitation. It’s so encouraging to see neuroplasticity at play in
          such a tangible way!
        </p>
        <h3>
          <span
            >Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
            time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
            course?</span
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think the school is focussing on these core skills because they see
          the huge value in the ‘soft skills’. Employers want emotionally
          intelligent, kind, team players. By focussing on these skills now -
          during the high-pressure environments of foundations and bootcamp -
          employers can trust that in high stress work situations we will be
          equipped to cope and thrive.
        </p>
        <h3>
          <span
            >Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
            waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
            programming instead? Justify your answer.</span
          >
        </h3>
        <p>
          Absolutely not. I feel so encouraged from what I have learned and put
          into practise during this learning process. It was a huge draw factor
          to EDA for me, and I feel well equipped to go forth into BootCamp
          knowing that when things get rough I can tune into the learning and
          practices I have acquired in order to manage the situation in a
          healthy and safe way.
        </p>
        <p>
          If I was only learning programming I may have seriously considered
          leaving, because I wouldn’t have been able to face my limitations in
          the same healthy, informed way.
