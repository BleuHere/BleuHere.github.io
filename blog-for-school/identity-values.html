          <div><h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h3>
            <p>The decision: advocating for myself when someone was crossing my personal boundaries.</p>
            <p>The values in question were integrity and communication.</p>
            <p>A person made me feel uncomfortable by hitting on me after I had expressed I wasn’t interested in dating them. This was crossing my personal boundaries and made me uncomfortable and feel a little unsafe.</p> 
            <p>I considered the best course of action. I reflected on the situation and also discussed the situation with some close friends in order to see different perspectives. My friends gave me some good input and helped me to empathize with this person, even though I felt impacted negatively by their actions.</p>
            <p>I decided to confront this person and tell them how I felt. I felt quite nervous, because I didn’t know how they would react, and I also felt the pressure to communicate my thoughts in a compassionate and clear way - a way that would ultimately be useful for this person too.</p>
            <p>I feel I was able to communicate how I felt, and how their actions had impacted me. I set clear personal boundaries around my desired interactions with them going forward, and explained why I was taking the time to communicate with them.</p>
            <p>The result was that I felt I had given firm but ultimately useful feedback to this person. I felt I had lived embodying my values, and I also felt that - if this person chooses to take action on the feedback they received - then they will be able to interact with others in a kinder, more considered way.</p>
            <p>Being a self-advocate (as well as being an advocate for others) is something that is really important to me. This involves using my voice in a considered, clear way, and holding others accountable for their actions.</p></div>
          <div><h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p>I grew up having really kind, generous, accepting role models in my whanau. I think that their active altruism and outpouring of kindness has influenced my values in a big way. 
            <p>My grandparents in particular are really wonderful people, and I feel really grateful to be close to them. They have lived their lives very closely to their values of love, generosity, and advocating for and uplifting others. Their unwavering commitment to their values has been very impactful. They have helped me to shape my personal values, and have taught me about embodying my core values through action and discussion.</p>
            <p>Another culture that has impacted me quite a lot is the Argentinian culture. I spent some time in Argentina, and have a lot of friends from there. I admire my Argentine friends - I find them to be critical thinkers - they don’t tend to shy away from the big questions and they welcome hard conversations. They care deeply about the socio-political landscape of their country and the wider world. When I was briefly immersed in this culture I rapidly grew from the feedback I received, the openness of my friends sharing their vulnerabilities, and the way I felt accepted and seen. This culture really shifted my worldview and informs much of my communication style and my curiosity about human connection.</p></div>
          <div><h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
            <h4>Strengths:</h4>
              <p>I am good at making connections. I have the ability to connect dots and create useful analogies that help me to solidify concepts in my brain. I can communicate these to others which makes me a good teacher, and great in a team because I include others with different levels of understanding through these analogies.</p>
              <p>I enjoy a tough mental exercise and feel great when immersed in a problem (until I fall into a hole - read below). This shows my focus and determination - both of which are really helpful in the learning sphere.</p>
            <h4>Limitations:</h4>
              <p>Because I am accustomed to rapid understanding/absorption of learning material, when I really do have to think about things and spend time in the sphere of <em>‘what the heck does that mean, and how the heck does it connect to that other thingy???’</em> I find myself falling into a hole of despair, overwhelm and insecurity. I find this quite hard to recover from. I am actively working on self compassion to be able to work through those feelings and have healthy expectations about my learning ability and to separate my performance from my self worth.</p>
              <p>Because I have high expectations of myself, I also have high expectations of others, and find that at times I can get impatient when I think someone <em>‘should have got it by now’</em>. This ugly beast rears its head but it’s something I have worked on expressing in a healthy way - i.e. transition into teaching/supporting mode and apply patience and encouragement, or practise compassion and remind myself that everyone has a different learning style and everyone turns up with different resources every day. I don’t always get it right, so sometimes I just fall back to trying my best to practice kindness, or I take myself away from the situation for a bit of a break.</p></div>
          <div><h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
              <p>One of my strengths is self-awareness. It’s something I’ve worked hard to grow into and is something I hope to continue to develop throughout my life. This strength helps me to catch myself in a pattern of despair (for example) and I can look at the situation and apply a suitable coping mechanism - things I have practised and are tried and true. At the moment, my big focus is on catching thoughts of <em>‘I’m so stupid, I suck as a person’</em> and turn them into <em>‘wow, yeah this is hard right now. But I am worthy of kindness and choose to be kind to myself. I’m gonna take a break for a bit so I can get back into my body’.</em></p>
              <p>Another strength is communication. I am generally able to say <em>‘hey, I’m gonna pop out for a bit because I’m feeling a lot and need some space to process this.’</em></p></div>
          <div><h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
            <p>I’ve been doing coding challenges to prepare for this course, and sometimes they stump me!! I ask my partner to help me to de-code (haha, sorry) the mystery. 
              <p>At the start, it was really hard for me to learn alongside him. He’s so much more experienced than me, and instead of reminding myself of that, I wanted to keep up - understand all the jargon, learn the logic after hearing it once, and write perfect code that worked first time and needed no refactoring. I felt really stupid, and felt embarrassed that he’d see me <em>‘failing’.</em></p>
              <p><em>(Just FYI - he was so kind and patient in explaining concepts, asking me good questions and generally creating a safe space for me to make mistakes and learn from them. All the yucky feelings were being triggered internally and related to my unrealistic expectations of my own performance).</em></p>
              <p>Anyway, a few sets of tears later we figured out that stepping away from the screen and talking through a plan of attack in plain English worked really well. I didn’t feel like I was performing, I just felt like I was having a chat about an issue that I wanted perspective on - something I really value in life, as well as coding related subject matter.</p>
              <p>The success in this method was related to the fact that I was not able to feel okay in myself when I made mistakes in front of someone. It’s something that triggered some unresolved self worth stuff, and I found it really hard to bounce back after feeling those big feelings. So instead of painstakingly feeling those emotions, we tried something I already find value in (verbal processing with a friend) and we applied that to the issue.</p>
              <p>This is a fairly recent discovery, so I will continue to apply this while I work on self compassion and disarming those big scary feelings. I understand that it’s really important to learn how to make mistakes with others around, so I’m going to try to do some intentional mistake making and synthetically feel those big feelings with people I feel safe with, then slowly progress until I’m making mistakes in front of an audience and have the ability to say <em>‘oops’</em> and move on without shame or despair coming to hang out.</p></div>
