          <p>Oh hey peeps! It’s me again (it’s my blog, I live here).</p>
          <p>
            This study week has been all about JavaScript (js) and emotional
            intelligence practices. It’s been cool.
          </p>

          <h3><span>Key Takeaways this Week:</span></h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Being prepared is a great feeling. I did a codecademy javascript
              course because I had been told that js is the make-it-or-hate it
              decider for many people who learn coding. I’m pro bungy-jumping
              and mid-winter dipping but course-enrolling in a completely
              foreign arena is not the kind of risk taking I am in support of.
              So anyway, I did this js crash course and it made this week really
              manageable. I’m so glad I didn’t have to learn all the things for
              the first time because I would be crying right now. I did all* my
              crying during the crash course so that’s out of the way for now.
            </li>
            <li>
              I learned this really cool skill called ‘looping’ this week as
              part of the emotional intelligence curriculum. Looping is
              listening without interruption then repeating what the person has
              said to you back to them in your own words. It was quite profound
              for me to do this exercise. I realise how much I interrupt, and
              how my listening could be of a much higher calibre! Sorry about
              that. I’m going to be focussing on listening with less
              interruption because I really enjoyed the feeling of connection
              with my exercise partner. Do you wanna try this with me? I’d love
              to do this with people I know IRL too.
            </li>
            <li>Just two takeaways this week cas they’re pretty meaty.</li>

          <h3><span>Who in the WWW is she?</span></h3>
          <h4><span>Hedy Lamarr</span></h4>

          <p>
            Austrian-born American-based inventor and actress, Hedy Lamarr was
            the multi-talented woman donned the “Mother of Wifi”.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly to our last Woman in Tech,
            <a class="body-link" href="/blog-for-you/first-post.html"
              >Ada Lovelace</a
            >, Hedy Lamarr had parents on differing ends of the arts/science
            spectrum. Her mother was a concert pianist, her father a curious man
            interested in the inner workings of the mechanical world. Also like
            Lovelace, Lamarr was influenced by both of her parents.
          </p>
          <p>
            She was snaffled up by Hollywood in the late 1930s for her talent
            and beauty and went on to have an illustrious career on the silver
            screen. Her innovative genius was
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://www.womenshistory.org/education-resources/biographies/hedy-lamarr"
              >encouraged by pilot Howard Hughes</a
            >, and later she met George Antheil - another arts/science
            mover-shaker.
          </p>
          <p>
            A patriot of her new country, Lamarr committed herself to the USA
            war effort and with Antheil, invented a war-time communication
            system that helped torpedos reach their targets. In short:
            “They found a way for the radio guidance transmitter and the
            torpedo’s receiver to jump simultaneously from frequency to
            frequency, making it impossible for the enemy to locate and block a
            message before it had moved to another frequency. This approach
            became known as “frequency-hopping”.”
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/thank-world-war-ii-era-film-star-your-wi-fi-180971584/"
              >Quoted from here</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though this technology was created with war in mind,
            frequency-hopping is used today in
            <a
              class="body-link"
              href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hedy-lamarr-movie-star-inventor-of-wifi/"
              >many wireless communication systems</a
            >. Lamarr never earned much from her invention (her potential
            earnings now estimated to be in the billions), however what I find
            more disappointing is that she was never known to be an inventor or
            innovator during her lifetime, despite her public status as an
            actress. As with many women in tech, her legacy was only celebrated
            long after her death, and during her life her intellectual side was
            met with skepticism and disbelief.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’ll leave you with this poignant quote from Lamarr: “any girl can
            be glamorous. All you have to do is stand still and look stupid”.
